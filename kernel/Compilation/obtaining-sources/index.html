  <strong>Cloning Kernel Sources:</strong> Linux is a clone of the operating system Unix, written from scratch by
  Linus Torvalds.
  You can clone kernel-hmp(HMP branch) or kernel-eas(EAS branch) branch of kernel.

  <strong>Cloning GCC Compiler:</strong> GCC is a program language compiler developed by GNU. It is a set of free
  software released under the GNU General Public License (GPL).
  You can clone either NON ELF or ELF / BARE METAL GCC for compilation, also there are stable-gcc and master branch.
  The only difference between these two branches is that stable-gcc is being built from stable release of gcc
  whereas master is being built from master (Continous updating branch) of GCC's sources.

  <strong>Clang:</strong> It is a compiler front end for the C, C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++ programming
  languages, as well as the OpenMP, OpenCL, RenderScript, CUDA and HIP frameworks. It uses the LLVM compiler
  infrastructure as its back end and has been part of the LLVM release cycle. It is designed to act
  as a drop-in replacement for the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC).

  <strong>Proton Clang:</strong> A LLVM and Clang compiler toolchain built for kernel development. Builds are always
  made from the latest LLVM sources rather than stable releases, so complete stability cannot be guaranteed.
