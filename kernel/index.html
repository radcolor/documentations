  RAD KERNEL for WHYRED
</p>
<br>
<p id="intro" class="lead">
  A clean custom Android Linux kernel for Redmi Note 5 Pro/AI (codenamed: whyred) with a blend of handy and neat
  features, newest linux kernel and CAF tags, and thorough tests. <br><br> this project lays out some quality
  stability to your device, also ensuring a sweet balance between device performance and its battery life. Hopefully
  getting you a bit closer to what you would wish to have out of your device.

  <strong>What is a Linux and a Kernel?</strong> <br>
  Pretty much correct. To me, "linux" is just the kernel. But it is pretty common to refer to entire distributions
  as linux. That is what annoys RMS so much. He maintains it should be called GNU/Linux, as he sees distributions as
  the linux kernel plus the additional software from the GNU project. This makes sense too but I never use the term
  GNU/Linux. I am either talking about the kernel linux, or "linux distributions", or a specific distribution.
  <br><br>
  So yes. A distribution is just the kernel (which may include distribution specific patches) plus all the extra
  programs that make it usable.
  <br><br>
  The kernel is a central project, and is nominally the same in each distro, but most distros customize it a bit.
  <br><br>
  And the extra software doesn't just make the kernel more user friendly, it makes it usable at all. A kernel is
  just interrupt handlers, device drivers, and system calls. It basically virtualizes the hardware and provides a
  standard environment for programs to work on.
  <br><br>
  As far as the phrase "operating system" goes, it can be confusing. Some people may say the kernel IS the operating
  system, and everything else is either a utility or an application or something else. Other people may say the
  kernel plus some other packages make up the operating system, but most of the software is not part of the
  operating system. Others may say all the software in the distro forms part of the operating system.

  <strong>What is an Android Kernel?</strong> <br>The Linux kernel is an extremely important part of the software on
  nearly every Android device. This section describes Linux kernel development and release models (below), stable
  and long-term supported (LTS) kernels (including why all Android devices should use stable releases instead of
  cherry picking patches), kernel configuration and hardening, requirements for interfaces and the modular kernels
  (introduced in Android O), kernel debugging and network testing, and SquashFS.

  <strong>What does "stable/EOL" and "longterm" mean?</strong> <br>As kernels move from the "mainline" into the
  "stable" category, two things can happen: <br><br>

  They can reach "End of Life" after a few bugfix revisions, which means that kernel maintainers will release no
  more bugfixes for this kernel version, or
  They can be put into "longterm" maintenance, which means that maintainers will provide bugfixes for this kernel
  revision for a much longer period of time. <br><br>
  If the kernel version you are using is marked "EOL," you should consider upgrading to the next major version as
  there will be no more bugfixes provided for the kernel version you are using.
